Vigenere’sDescription.This software application encrypts and decrypts messages using the Vigenere’s method. For more information on this method:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigenère_cipherFiles enclosed for demonstration.The folder containing this program in the repository has two text files. The file plainText.txt contains the unencrypted message, while encrypted.txt is the encrypted version of the plain-text message. The keyword for the encryption/decryption of these messages is mysterious.User’s guide.In order to execute the program it is necessary to compile and run it through command line. For executing it, it is necessary to input three arguments through command line. The first one is the keyword of the encryption/decryption and the second one represents the command to tell the program to encipher or decipher the message. The second argument can be “encipher” or “decipher”. The third argument represents the name of the text file that wants to be encrypted or decryptedInput example:EARLY ON IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE RUMRUNNERS WEREENCRYPTING THEIR COMMUNICATIONS TO THWART THE COAST GUARDSMISSION AND BY NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE USE OF CODES ANDCIPHERS AMONG RUMRUNNING VESSELS WAS COMMONPLACE WITH THISKIND OF EXPERTISE AT WORK IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE SMUGGLERSSYSTEMS GREW INCREASINGLY COMPLEX TO COUNTER THEIR EFFORTSTHE USCG ENLISTED THE HELP OF RENOWNED CRYPTOLOGIST ELIZEBETHFRIEDMAN FRIEDMAN WAS CONSIDERED AN EXPERT IN THE CRYPTOLOGICREALM SHE HAD STUDIED THE SUBJECT AT A CHICAGO AREA THINK TANKAND HAD PARTICIPATED IN CRYPTOLOGIC WORK AT OTHER FEDERALAGENCIES HER ROLE WAS TO PROVIDE THE COAST GUARD SOME MEASUREOF FOREWARNING REGARDING THE RUMRUNNERS OPERATIONALACTIVITIES THIS WAS NO EASY TASK THE VARIOUS SYNDICATES TOOKSTRONG MEASURES TO PROTECT THEIR COMMUNICATIONS FROM THECOAST GUARD NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH WAS PAYING THE UNHEARD OFSUM OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO A RETIRED ROYAL NAVYLIEUTENANT COMMANDER TO RUN THEIR CRYPTOLOGIC OPERATIONS.Output example:Input Message: EARLY ON IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE RUMRUNNERS WERE ENCRYPTING THEIR COMMUNICATIONS TO THWART THE COAST GUARDS MISSION AND BY NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE USE OF CODES AND CIPHERS AMONG RUMRUNNING VESSELS WAS COMMONPLACE WITH THIS KIND OF EXPERTISE AT WORK IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE SMUGGLERS SYSTEMS GREW INCREASINGLY COMPLEX TO COUNTER THEIR EFFORTS THE USCG ENLISTED THE HELP OF RENOWNED CRYPTOLOGIST ELIZEBETH FRIEDMAN FRIEDMAN WAS CONSIDERED AN EXPERT IN THE CRYPTOLOGIC REALM SHE HAD STUDIED THE SUBJECT AT A CHICAGO AREA THINK TANK AND HAD PARTICIPATED IN CRYPTOLOGIC WORK AT OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES HER ROLE WAS TO PROVIDE THE COAST GUARD SOME MEASURE OF FOREWARNING REGARDING THE RUMRUNNERS OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES THIS WAS NO EASY TASK THE VARIOUS SYNDICATES TOOK STRONG MEASURES TO PROTECT THEIR COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE COAST GUARD NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH WAS PAYING THE UNHEARD OF SUM OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO A RETIRED ROYAL NAVY LIEUTENANT COMMANDER TO RUN THEIR CRYPTOLOGIC OPERATIONS.Output Message: QYJEC FVWNT QASFI RXDUJ QLLML RBHBW DSEKY EVSLK ICJXI EKFSH FGFZX YMWLU AKENR ZKONA ALKMS KPKUJ FRZXG FIGNY GYJWW DQGMA ALSGH SGBCF QRWXR EQBYL KQWOI EBVYM ECGYG FLSMS ZBUBT YMFMS YMFZV LUFOF ZGFZZ VAGYD EUSLG FUAIF BJSVI NQHBL TGKDM ELCZW JNWKX ZASUL IMJDM KEOMF ARDHR XJSZG DCLAI JUIAY XCJLW PAHYE EEJXA ZVQLW MQAGK CGQIE BJWQX FKCOF FCJML VQFYX RMJMW KPSOK OEWGP ZAHYV FFWAI CXCZJ QLGPR VLQLQ BRGES XQGNW XGRXF VBVZJ UCVFE ENFCW PKSGA RAQIF EGVXV VLOHW JNWKX ZVHBW OPQIX FTCAA OPWTP DAVYZ MBKMY UQSXL TCKNF AMQNS FYUAM TIUIS DCSML ZVYNS ZISGH YIRJS DRAVM GIHYV ULUKC GBCFG SGUPS ISONG FFWKJ VLSLS XYYXR TQSMZ QPJHP VEOML ANJHZ ZLSNZ QAGTW KOIUJ PQGFI DMOMM DCGYJ FZSQS DLAGK IMUUJ PGFZX YMFOE DSFGI IACJW DYLBS EIZUU FGNBX ZMGNZ UQOTW EWSUK KRSLO KPSPS DGGNW JGBXA OYLXW KWCEK FPGGK DMOMM DCKMS GZCNW ORLAI ZZQIE YSFBG RBWIF EDJHQ KPSWG MQLZY RZRHG FRZXP VIGNG RUZBG YEOMH MWAGK KPSOF TCSKH FNGOE ADLXR KPCOK MLVWS CTOLK MWWTV KWOLW FGJXH IWMUD ZYNRP ZMINW ZYFMG FUAUF PCJMS ICBNZ QGJVV PXHID AEAVS GMFUL UMFLProgram’s Design.Important Variables.The program uses two String global variables, input and output, that store the message given to the program and the results of the process, whether it was an encipher or decipher tasks. transformEncrypt(char , char).This method takes two arguments of type char. One of them is the character of the keyword and the other is the plain-text letter whose encryption is related to the mentioned letter of the key. This fragment of code returns the cipher-text character obtained by encrypting the plain-text character using Vigenere’s techinique.transformDecrypt(char , char).This method takes two arguments of type char. One of them is the character of the keyword and the other is the cipher-text letter whose decryption is related to the mentioned letter of the key. This fragment of code returns the plain-text character obtained by decrypting the cipher-text character using Vigenere’s techinique.encipherToken().The method takes a string and enciphers it using Vigenere’s technique. It also takes the string and stores it in the input variable, while storing the result of the encryption in the output variable.decipherToken().The method takes a string and deciphers it using Vigenere’s technique. It also takes the string and stores it into the input variable, while storing the result of the decryption in the output variable.main().The main reads the text of the input file and decrypts/encrypts every line of it using encipherToken() or decipherToken(). At the end, it prints the input and output of the processes by using the mentioned global variables. Furthermore, it is also necessary to mention that this method deals with possible three invalid arguments from the command line by showing a message about the error and ending the program.
