Letter Frequency AnalysisDescription.This application counts the frequency of each letter on a message. This program is useful for cryptanalysis.Files enclosed for demonstration.The folder containing this program in the repository, has a text file called message1.txt. This text file can be used to demonstrate the functionality of the program	User’s guide.In order to execute the program is necessary to compile and run it through command line. For executing it, it is necessary to input an argument through command line. This argument represents the name of the text file whose message will be analyzed by the letter frequency analysis.Input example:N BMJJQJI RD HFWY YTBFWI HZXYTRX FSI XFB RDXJQK UJWKJHYQD UWTKNQJI YMWTZLM YMJ HTRUZYJW'X JDJX.

This data structure is used to store the frequencies of the characters in the message.Methods.analyzeToken(String).This method takes a string and traverses through it in order to record the occurrences of its Alphabetic characters. These occurrences are stored in the HashMap frecuency.printFrecuency().This method prints the one-to-one relations of the HashMap in order to show the letter frequencies of the characters.histogram().This method prints a histogram that represents the frequencies of a character using X’s as each occurrence. This method uses the one-to-one relations from the HashMap.main().The main method initializes the HashMap and reads in the input. It parses every line of the input and uses analyzeToken() to study the frequencies of the characters of each line. Once this happens, then it uses printFrecuency() and histogram() to print the frequencies of the characters and a histogram that represent them. This method also manages the possibility of getting an argument with an incorrect or non-existing file name by giving a message explaining the error and ending the program’s execution.
